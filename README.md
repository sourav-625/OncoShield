# 🛡️ OncoShield – Non-Invasive Tumor Detection System

OncoShield is a non-invasive, AI-based Tumor Detection System that integrates **Thermography**, **Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR)**, and **Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)** to provide early-stage Tumor  detection. It uses a hybrid machine learning model and is built with a modern web interface to make early diagnosis more accessible, affordable, and scalable.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌡️ Combines multiple non-invasive sensing technologies (Thermal, NIR, EIS)
- 🤖 AI-based prediction using CNN and LSTM
- 💻 Frontend built with **React.js** for real-time interaction (under development)
- 📊 Time-windowed analysis for greater diagnostic accuracy
- ☁️ Backend and cloud-hosted ML model (planned)

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

### 🔷 Frontend *(in development)*
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- TailwindCSS / Material UI (optional)
- Axios (for API calls)
- Git & GitHub

### 🔶 Backend *(in development)*
- Node.js + Express.js for API development
- MongoDB or Firebase for database
- Cloud-hosted ML inference (Flask/TensorFlow Serving API)
- Authentication and user management

### ⚙️ Machine Learning Model *(Recently Integrated)*
- CNN for image-based thermography & NIR input
- LSTM for sequential EIS signal data
- Ensemble Learning for final classification
